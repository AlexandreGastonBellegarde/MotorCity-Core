### Step one: Preparing Unity
please [download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) the corresponding version Unity and install it on your machine. It is highly recommended to 
download and install Unity through [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe?_ga=2.187579435.2096600450.1550663193-640931691.1544444769).
It is easier to manage various installations of Unity when using Unity Hub. You can find more information on Unity Hub [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedUnityHub.html).
#### notice:

> Please always make sure you are using the unity version mentioned here to ensure correct build and functionality of Westdrive. 

### Step two: cloning the project
First make sure you have installed a git client on you machine. If you need one you can find many of them online. Alternatively you can just [download](https://desktop.github.com/) and install
official Github client for Microsot Windows. 
> if you just want to use Project westdrive you can alternatively dowload the project as an archive file (see below), however to contribute to the project or make your own forks you will need a GitLab [account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane).
